DISCLAIMER: this project is a working version from an old project, which must be considerably updated.

In this project, I developed a Python-based tool to perform 3D displacement and strain measurement of a specimen using Digital Image Correlation (DIC). The tool aims to integrate modern OpenGL-based visualization and a variety of data processing techniques to simulate and analyze displacement and deformation of materials under load. It handles 3D spatial data, visualizes deformation, and computes geometric transformations of the specimen to track its behavior.

This tool might be helpful for scientific research who want to speed up the analysis process:
- directly analyse outliers without proprietary software interfering the the analysis
- manipulate directly datapoint to be added in a FEM-mesh
- check deformation points of each recorded frame
- evaluate additional custom based parameters
